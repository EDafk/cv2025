    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <div class="projects">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Login and Register simple app</h3>
        <p>This is one of my first applications that I made during study time. In this app made with the Javascript, user have an option to register new account
          and login with that account. 
          After succesfull registration and login process, user can write a blogs that will be visible to all users.
          The app is made with the plain Javascript, HTML and CSS. The idea was to make a simple app that will have a login and register functionality where user can write a blog. 
          Further idea is to make user levels where user can have a different access to the app.
          You can try the app by clicking to this link: <a target="_blank" href="https://edafk.github.io/loginRegisterApp/">Login and Register app</a>.

        <h3>Groceries store project</h3>
        <p>This was my most challenging project. This mini app has been made with the plain PHP language without any frameworks used. The idea was to connect the database 
          with the PHP and to make a simple groceries store app. The user can add, edit, and delete products from the store. Unfortunately, as the GitHub does not support PHP and can not 
          run it on the server as its a dynamic language I can only share the code of this project. You can find the code on my GitHub profile: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EDafk/groceriesStore">Groceries store project</a>.
