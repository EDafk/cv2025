    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
I am Elvir Dervišević, born on October 7, 1992.

Regarding my formal education, I graduated from high school as an Electro Technician in 2012. After that, I began my studies at the Faculty of Law, University of Travnik, where I graduated in 2017.

In 2021, I completed a one-year PHP Web Developer course at the IT Academy in Sarajevo. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, going to the gym, and reading about economics.

My first work experience was as a warehouse worker at Coca-Cola HBC during the summer of 2014. <br><br> In 2015, I worked as a receptionist at a male student dormitory, where I handled room reservations and organization,
greeted visitors, performed data entry, and maintained office calendars and schedules.

In 2020, I worked as a sales assistant at a gas station, where my main tasks included selling products such as food, drinks, and newspapers, re-stocking shelves and fridges, and managing fuel and stock deliveries.
I worked there until July 2022.
<br><br>
In September 2022, I began my career at DDC MLS as a Customer Support Agent, a position I held until July 2024. After that, I transitioned to my current role as a Customs Agent for our Italian client.   </p>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <div class="projects">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Login and Register form-blog app</h3>
        <p>This is one of my first and most complex applications that I made during study time. In this app made with the Javascript, upon opening the link user have an option to register new account
          and login with existing account. As the app is not connected with the static database User data is saved only during the session so after closing the browser all data will be lost. <br>

          After succesfull registration and login process, user can write a blogs that will be visible to all users.
          The app is made with the plain Javascript, HTML and CSS. The idea was to make a simple app that will have a login and register functionality where user can write a blog. <br><br>
          Further idea is to make user levels where user can have a different access to the app. Head Admin will be able to delete and edit all blogs, Admin will be able to delete and edit only his blogs, 
          while User will be able only to write a blog. <br> 
          There is also a search option where user can search blogs by the author name but this option is not functional yet <br>
          You can try the app by clicking to this link: <a target="_blank" href="https://edafk.github.io/loginRegisterApp/">Login and Register app</a>.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Groceries store project</h3>
        <p>This was my most challenging project. This mini app has been made with the plain PHP language without any frameworks used. The idea was to connect the database 
          with the PHP and to make a simple groceries store app. The user can add, edit, and delete products from the store. Unfortunately, as the GitHub does not support PHP and can not 
          run it on the server as its a dynamic language I can only share the code of this project. You can find the code on my GitHub profile: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EDafk/groceriesStore">Groceries store project</a>.

        <h3>Very simple HTML and CSS assignment</h3>
        <p>In this project I made a simple circle that is rotating the colours. You can see it here: <a target="_blank" href="https://edafk.github.io/Assignment-Animation/">Animation assignment</a> </p>
